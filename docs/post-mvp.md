**Project Repository:** `bar191/jules`

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the phased development plan to evolve the "Jules-Inspired AI Coding Assistant" **beyond its revised 6-phase Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. The goal is to transform it into a comprehensive, highly intelligent, and enterprise-ready custom version that deeply mirrors and potentially surpasses the advanced capabilities associated with Google's Jules.

The **revised 6-phase MVP** (detailed in `/docs/project_details.md` and `/plans/phaseX/`) establishes a robust foundation including:
*   Secure, containerized task execution.
*   Core AI workflow (plan -> diff -> test -> PR).
*   GitHub App integration for webhook-triggered tasks.
*   Audio summaries.
*   Basic LLM selection and task queuing.

This Post-MVP plan focuses on significant enhancements in:
*   **Deep Code Intelligence:** Advanced static analysis, semantic understanding, and context retrieval (RAG).
*   **Sophisticated AI Planning & Interaction:** Multi-step editable plans, iterative refinement dialogues.
*   **Enhanced User Experience & Control:** Rich task history, repository-specific configurations, IDE integration.
*   **Operational Excellence & Scalability:** Advanced error handling, robust monitoring, and further scalability improvements.
*   **Ecosystem & Enterprise Features:** Broader language support, team collaboration, advanced analytics.

The ultimate vision is an indispensable AI coding partner that is powerful, reliable, adaptable, and deeply integrated into developer workflows.

## 2. Guiding Principles for Post-MVP Development

*   **Build on Strength:** Leverage the robust, containerized, and integrated foundation of the revised MVP.
*   **Data-Driven Prioritization:** Use feedback from MVP users and (opt-in) telemetry to guide feature selection and refinement.
*   **Advanced AI Integration:** Explore and incorporate cutting-edge LLM techniques, agentic behaviors, and code intelligence methodologies.
*   **Extensibility & Maintainability:** Continue to design for modularity to accommodate new features and LLM advancements.
*   **Security & Reliability:** Maintain a high bar for security and system stability as complexity increases.

## 3. Post-MVP Phases Overview

This plan outlines major development thrusts, which can be broken down into more granular phases or sprints. The order represents a logical progression, but some parallelization may be possible.
